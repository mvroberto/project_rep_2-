```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r get_data, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

if(!file.exists("StormData.csv.bz2")){
  
    file <- download.file(url, destfile = "./StormData.csv.bz2", method = "curl")
    return(file)
}

  df <- read.csv(bzfile("stormdata.csv.bz2"))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
